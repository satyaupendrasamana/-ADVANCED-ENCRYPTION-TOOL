# Advanced Encryption Tool
This Python-based tool encrypts and decrypts files using AES-256 encryption.

## 📋 Features
✅ Encrypt any file securely  
✅ Decrypt files using the correct encryption key  
✅ Simple and easy-to-use interface  

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Run the Python script using the command:

python encryption_tool.py

2. Choose:
- **Option 1** to generate a new encryption key.
- **Option 2** to encrypt a file.
- **Option 3** to decrypt a file.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter file paths.

## 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library (Install using `pip install cryptography`)

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Do not share your `encryption_key.key` file**. Losing it will make decryption impossible.
- Store a backup of your encryption key securely.

## 📝 Example Commands
- Encrypt a file:
➔ Select **Option 2** ➔ Enter file path (e.g., `sample.txt`)  

- Decrypt a file:
➔ Select **Option 3** ➔ Enter file path (e.g., `sample.txt.encrypted`)
